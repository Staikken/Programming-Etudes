    "A LIFE community is a made up of cells that inhabit a square array. Every generation new cells may be born and old cells may die. A cell dies if it is lonely, that is it only has one neighbor (in the eight squares immediately surrounding it) or if it gets over crowded, if there are more than three neighbors. A new cell may be born only if there is an empty square with exactly three neighboring cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge: Write a program that simulates a LIFE community. The input should be the initial positions of the communitiy's cells and the putput and aerial view of the community at each generation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notes: Some communities grow enormously from small beginnings.  Others transport themselves slowly across the plane. Your program should be able to handle large communities without a terrific cost in space or time.\n"

    "Keeping everything in an array will likely include a lot of irrelivant squares. Given a set of active points (xy coordinates) you have the initial active points, all of their neighboring points and if any of those neighboring points are empty, their neighboring points. You need that last category to evaluate the potential new cell locations. \n",
    "Therefore the max number of locations you need to keep track of is 25n for n active locations. In all likelyhood however many of these locations will overlap. \n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanics of the simulation are modeled in the LIFEstate class and the animation details are handled in the Animate class which is then passed to the Matplotlib function FuncAnimation."
